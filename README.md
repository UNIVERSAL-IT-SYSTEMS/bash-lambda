# Bash lambda

Real lambda support for bash (a functionally complete hack):

Load the library into your shell (this can go into .bashrc):
```
$ . bash-lambda
```

Start allocating closures and stuff:
```
$ add=$(fn x y 'echo $((x + y))')
$ map $(partial $add 5) $(list 1 2 3 4)
6
7
8
9
$ iterate $(partial $add 2) 3 | take 4
3
5
7
9
```

Higher-order functions work like you would expect:
```
$ sum_list=$(partial reduce $add 0)
$ $sum_list $(list 1 2 3)
6
$ rand_int=$(fn 'echo $RANDOM')
$ repeatedly $rand_int 100 | $sum_list
1566864

$ our_numbers=$(list $(repeatedly $rand_int 100))
```

Closures:
Two ways to take an average. One is to close over the anonymous function
`$sum_list`:
```
$ average=$(fn xs "echo \$((\$($sum_list \$xs) / \$(wc -l < \$xs)))")
$ $average $our_numbers
14927
```

The other is to make the 'average' function visible within closures by giving
it a name. While we're at it, let's do the same for `sum_list`; that way we
won't need to close over `$sum_list` and escape a bunch of variables.
```
$ def sum-list $sum_list
$ defn average xs 'echo $(($(sum-list $xs) / $(wc -l < $xs)))'
```

Named functions don't need to be dereferenced, since they aren't variables:
```
$ average $our_numbers
14927
```

Save a function or value for later (note that this won't fully save function
cross-references, which are generated by things like `partial`):
```
$ cp $our_numbers foo
$ cp $average bar       # Doesn't always work; depends on other fns
$ ./bar foo
```
